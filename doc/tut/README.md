# easyout Tutorial

The easyout library tutorial. Documentation [here](https://github.com/Lasoloz/easyout/tree/master/doc/gen). (I'll make a generated documentation as soon as I have time, there is nothing yet)

## Table of contents

At the end of these tutorials you will probably know everything important about easyout. If you want more details, use the documentation (when it's ready)

I also assume, that you have a basic understanding about the following terms: C++, C++11, streams, threads, mutexes, variadic templates, smart pointers.
