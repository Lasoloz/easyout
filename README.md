# easyout

## Briefing

A simple (I hope) library for outputting message (i.e. logging).

I created this library when I wanted to output information to different targets (file, standard out), but I also had to share these targets (specific example: my chat client has to log the sent messages to a "transcript" target and to the logging targets).

I'm certain, that the library has a few flaws, but I'll try to do my best to optimize and make it better.

## How to use it?

Wait a little bit... I just finished the basic parts of the library, but I'll update this section as soon as possible. :P
